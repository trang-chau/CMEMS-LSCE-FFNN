# DESCRIPTION
Observation-based data reconstructions of global surface ocean carbonate system variables play an essential role in
monitoring the recent status of ocean carbon uptake and ocean acidification as well as their impacts on marine organisms and ecosystems. 

This Python source code exemplifies a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) model designed to estimate surface ocean CO2 fugacity (fuCO2). It was in the construction of an ensemble approach of FFNN models, namely **CMEMS-LSCE-FFNN**, which was developed at *Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de lâ€™Environnement (LSCE)* under the *Copernicus Marine
Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) project* for sustainably reconstructing observation-derived global ocean carbonate system datasets at high space-time resolution. 

The FFNN provided here is trained on Surface Ocean CO2 ATlas (SOCAT) gridded data of fuCO2 and a suite of environmental variables (e.g., sea surface temperature - SST, salinity - SSS, Chlorophyll - CHL,...) in May to July over the period 1985-2021. 

This source code was used to reproduce global ocean surface fuCO2 (Chau et al., 2022) and to consequently derive many carbon variables such as pH, air-sea fluxes, dissolved inorganic carbon (Chau et al., 2023) and  in the manuscript *Comparison of simulation-based algorithms for parameter estimation and state reconstruction in nonlinear state-space models* published in Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems Series S (DOI: 10.3934/dcdss.2022054).
